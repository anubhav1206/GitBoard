## Local Development

If you want to set up the GitBoard project for local development, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone

 the GitBoard repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aashay28/GitBoard.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd GitBoard
```

3. Install the project dependencies using pnpm (preferred) or npm:

```bash
pnpm install
```
or
```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
